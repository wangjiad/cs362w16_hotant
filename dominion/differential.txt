After using diff to compare the two gameResults.out with the same random seed, the two game results ended up with completely different scores and end deck counts. My random tester is very thorough with a gcov of "Lines executed:73.18% of 645". The average game takes approximately 500 rounds to finish. I tested my code against Jake Jeffreys dominion code. His code finished a game in 613 rounds, and mine finished in 540 rounds. My games are too long, different and thorough for diff to be actually useful since almost every line is different after a certain round in the game. By going line by line, I can see that Jakes error starts when the player 0â€™s 2nd round of hands begins. The score is wrong, and this error compounds onto itself as the game progresses creating even more differing code output. However, our random kingdom card initialization is the same along with many of the first player hands, which means that the random seed is the same for both codes. Therefore the problem is in the implementation of our dominion codes. Looking at the first couple rounds of each game, I can already see that Jake's code does not implement the score function correctly, which is a bug I recently fixed. This diff test is not completely useless though. It informs me that one of our code has a major bug that cascades into more differences as the game progresses. It also tells me that my random game tester tests a very specific branch of a possible game and any deviation in the dominion code will cause the results of the game to deviate down a different branch changing the end decks and scores.
