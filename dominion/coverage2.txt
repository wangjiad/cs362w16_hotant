Bug Report:
Found a bug in smithy that adds incorrect amount of cards to hand.
Other than that no bugs found in my unit tests.

My code coverage for all these tests came out to be 27.04% of 651 lines executed.
This percentage is quite low which indicates we have unlikely covered most edges, node and paths of the program, however I built my unit tests to test the essential functionality of each function or card, therefore if I were instead to test edge cases or uncommon cases, I would likely find more errors since these are more often not found at the initial creation of a program.
