Summary of error:   	Smithy not adding correct amount of cards

Smithy only adds 1 card. It should add 3 cards - 1 discard so the number of cards after should equal 2. 
Error is in following code snippet:

for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
{
  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
}

0 to less than 2 is only 2 iterations until the stopping condition is met.

Test code output:

*** Starting Smithy Unit Test. ***
numCards before: 5
numCards after: 6
Test failed
